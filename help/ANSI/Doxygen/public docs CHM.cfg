# Doxyfile 1.7.3

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project
#
# All text after a hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored
# The format is:
#       TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists items can also be appended using:
#       TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (" ")

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded 
# by quotes) that should identify the project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "TimoSoft EditControls"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. 
# This could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or 
# if some version control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         = 1.10.3.209

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) 
# base path where the generated documentation will be put. 
# If a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the location 
# where doxygen was started. If left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = help/ANSI/Doxygen/public

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES then Doxygen will prepend the full 
# path before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set 
# to NO the shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used.

FULL_PATH_NAMES        = NO

# The TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab. 
# Doxygen uses this value to replace tabs by spaces in code fragments.

TAB_SIZE               = 2

# This tag can be used to specify a number of aliases that acts 
# as commands in the documentation. An alias has the form "name=value". 
# For example adding "sideeffect=\par Side Effects:\n" will allow you to 
# put the command \sideeffect (or @sideeffect) in the documentation, which 
# will result in a user-defined paragraph with heading "Side Effects:". 
# You can put \n's in the value part of an alias to insert newlines.

ALIASES                = "usedin=\par Used in following samples:\n"

# If the MARKDOWN_SUPPORT tag is enabled then doxygen pre-processes all comments
# according to the Markdown format, which allows for more readable
# documentation. See http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ for details.
# The output of markdown processing is further processed by doxygen, so you can
# mix doxygen, HTML, and XML commands with Markdown formatting. Disable only in
# case of backward compatibilities issues.
# The default value is: YES.

MARKDOWN_SUPPORT       = NO

# If you use STL classes (i.e. std::string, std::vector, etc.) but do not want 
# to include (a tag file for) the STL sources as input, then you should 
# set this tag to YES in order to let doxygen match functions declarations and 
# definitions whose arguments contain STL classes (e.g. func(std::string); v.s. 
# func(std::string) {}). This also makes the inheritance and collaboration 
# diagrams that involve STL classes more complete and accurate.

BUILTIN_STL_SUPPORT    = YES

# If member grouping is used in the documentation and the DISTRIBUTE_GROUP_DOC 
# tag is set to YES, then doxygen will reuse the documentation of the first 
# member in the group (if any) for the other members of the group. By default 
# all members of a group must be documented explicitly.

DISTRIBUTE_GROUP_DOC   = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Build related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS tag is set to YES, Doxygen will hide all 
# undocumented members of documented classes, files or namespaces. 
# If set to NO (the default) these members will be included in the 
# various overviews, but no documentation section is generated. 
# This option has no effect if EXTRACT_ALL is enabled.

HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS     = YES

# If the HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES tag is set to YES, Doxygen will hide all 
# undocumented classes that are normally visible in the class hierarchy. 
# If set to NO (the default) these classes will be included in the various 
# overviews. This option has no effect if EXTRACT_ALL is enabled.

HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES     = YES

# If the HIDE_IN_BODY_DOCS tag is set to YES, Doxygen will hide any 
# documentation blocks found inside the body of a function. 
# If set to NO (the default) these blocks will be appended to the 
# function's detailed documentation block.

HIDE_IN_BODY_DOCS      = YES

# If the HIDE_SCOPE_NAMES tag is set to NO (the default) then Doxygen 
# will show members with their full class and namespace scopes in the 
# documentation. If set to YES the scope will be hidden.

HIDE_SCOPE_NAMES       = YES

# If the SHOW_INCLUDE_FILES tag is set to YES (the default) then Doxygen 
# will put a list of the files that are included by a file in the documentation 
# of that file.

SHOW_INCLUDE_FILES     = NO

# If the SORT_MEMBER_DOCS tag is set to YES (the default) then doxygen 
# will sort the (detailed) documentation of file and class members 
# alphabetically by member name. If set to NO the members will appear in 
# declaration order.

SORT_MEMBER_DOCS       = NO

# The ENABLED_SECTIONS tag can be used to enable conditional 
# documentation sections, marked by \if sectionname ... \endif.

ENABLED_SECTIONS       = PUBLICDOC \
                         ANSI

# Set the SHOW_USED_FILES tag to NO to disable the list of files generated 
# at the bottom of the documentation of classes and structs. If set to YES the 
# list will mention the files that were used to generate the documentation.

SHOW_USED_FILES        = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag can be used to specify the files and/or directories that contain 
# documented source files. You may enter file names like "myfile.cpp" or 
# directories like "/usr/src/myproject". Separate the files or directories 
# with spaces.

INPUT                  = src

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the 
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard pattern (like *.cpp 
# and *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left 
# blank the following patterns are tested: 
# *.c *.cc *.cxx *.cpp *.c++ *.d *.java *.ii *.ixx *.ipp *.i++ *.inl *.h *.hh 
# *.hxx *.hpp *.h++ *.idl *.odl *.cs *.php *.php3 *.inc *.m *.mm *.dox *.py 
# *.f90 *.f *.for *.vhd *.vhdl

FILE_PATTERNS          = *.idl

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the 
# EXCLUDE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard patterns to exclude 
# certain files from those directories. Note that the wildcards are matched 
# against the file with absolute path, so to exclude all test directories 
# for example use the pattern */test/*

EXCLUDE_PATTERNS       = EditCtlsU.idl \
                         *_in.* \
                         *.cpp \
                         *.h \
                         *.c

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to source browsing
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the VERBATIM_HEADERS tag is set to YES (the default) then Doxygen 
# will generate a verbatim copy of the header file for each class for 
# which an include is specified. Set to NO to disable this.

VERBATIM_HEADERS       = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the HTML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS tag is set to YES then the generated HTML 
# documentation will contain sections that can be hidden and shown after the 
# page has loaded. For this to work a browser that supports 
# JavaScript and DHTML is required (for instance Mozilla 1.0+, Firefox 
# Netscape 6.0+, Internet explorer 5.0+, Konqueror, or Safari).

HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS  = YES

# If the GENERATE_HTMLHELP tag is set to YES, additional index files 
# will be generated that can be used as input for tools like the 
# Microsoft HTML help workshop to generate a compiled HTML help file (.chm) 
# of the generated HTML documentation.

GENERATE_HTMLHELP      = YES

# If the GENERATE_HTMLHELP tag is set to YES, the CHM_FILE tag can 
# be used to specify the file name of the resulting .chm file. You 
# can add a path in front of the file if the result should not be 
# written to the html output directory.

CHM_FILE               = D:\Projects\EditControls\help\ANSI\Doxygen\public\chm\EditControls.chm

# If the GENERATE_HTMLHELP tag is set to YES, the HHC_LOCATION tag can 
# be used to specify the location (absolute path including file name) of 
# the HTML help compiler (hhc.exe). If non-empty doxygen will try to run 
# the HTML help compiler on the generated index.hhp.

HHC_LOCATION           = "C:\Program Files (x86)\HTML Help Workshop\hhc.exe"

# The GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is used to specify whether a tree-like index 
# structure should be generated to display hierarchical information. 
# If the tag value is set to YES, a side panel will be generated 
# containing a tree-like index structure (just like the one that 
# is generated for HTML Help). For this to work a browser that supports 
# JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required (i.e. any modern browser). 
# Windows users are probably better off using the HTML help feature.

GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the LaTeX output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will 
# generate Latex output.

GENERATE_LATEX         = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the preprocessor   
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PREDEFINED tag can be used to specify one or more macro names that 
# are defined before the preprocessor is started (similar to the -D option of 
# gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name 
# or name=definition (no spaces). If the definition and the = are 
# omitted =1 is assumed. To prevent a macro definition from being 
# undefined via #undef or recursively expanded use the := operator 
# instead of the = operator.

PREDEFINED             = DOXYGEN_SHOULD_SKIP_THIS \
                         ANSI

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the dot tool   
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the CLASS_DIAGRAMS tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will 
# generate a inheritance diagram (in HTML, RTF and LaTeX) for classes with base 
# or super classes. Setting the tag to NO turns the diagrams off. Note that 
# this option also works with HAVE_DOT disabled, but it is recommended to 
# install and use dot, since it yields more powerful graphs.

CLASS_DIAGRAMS         = NO

# When the SEARCHENGINE tag is enabled doxygen will generate a search box for
# the HTML output. The underlying search engine uses javascript and DHTML and
# should work on any modern browser. Note that when using HTML help
# (GENERATE_HTMLHELP), Qt help (GENERATE_QHP), or docsets (GENERATE_DOCSET)
# there is already a search function so this one should typically be disabled.
# For large projects the javascript based search engine can be slow, then
# enabling SERVER_BASED_SEARCH may provide a better solution. It is possible to
# search using the keyboard; to jump to the search box use <access key> + S
# (what the <access key> is depends on the OS and browser, but it is typically
# <CTRL>, <ALT>/<option>, or both). Inside the search box use the <cursor down
# key> to jump into the search results window, the results can be navigated
# using the <cursor keys>. Press <Enter> to select an item or <escape> to cancel
# the search. The filter options can be selected when the cursor is inside the
# search box by pressing <Shift>+<cursor down>. Also here use the <cursor keys>
# to select a filter and <Enter> or <escape> to activate or cancel the filter
# option.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

SEARCHENGINE           = NO
